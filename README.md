# CarParkSystem
I have implemented a multi-threading client- server system and Iâ€™ve shown how a car park management system can keep track of the number of available spaces as cars leave and enter a car park.

The car park can only fit 6 cars (3 in the ground floor and 3 in the bottom floor)

## To run the system

1. Run the server class
2. Run the client class
3. Run the car park 1 or 2 enterance class then type 'e' in the console to add a car from the car park
4. Run the car park 1 or 2 exit class then type 'e' in the console to exit a car park
5. The queue will be automatically managed
